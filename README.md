Hi, welcome to *the* **Dodo** platform!

## What is dodo? ##

*The* **Dodo** is a web platform that was originally meant to be a very flexible Google Docs alternative and can be used for many reasons, personally I like it to use it also as:

 - HTML Sandbox *(more like toybox)*
 - Blog *(using Disqus for comments)*

Documents are generated wiki-like, you type in a link, if it doesn't exists it asks you to create it.

Every document is made up of pages and every link is in this format:

  http://domain/user/document.page

If the page isn't specified, a page called "home" is used. Every document needs a "home" page to exists.

## How do I get it working? ##
The source published is the official source code, ready to be hosted at Google App Engine.

## Can't I just have an account on your server? ##
One of the reasons *the* **Dodo** is so flexible is because there are almost none security checks or CSRF filtering (in fact, I have a working exploit).  
I'm not going to fix it and because it can be quite dangerous to have people hosting those kind of scripts on my server, I prefer to have people hosting their own services.

Besides, App Engine is free to a certain extent and you get full administrator rights, so you really don't have excuses if you really want it.

## Okay, installed, how do I use it? ##

Tutorials are coming... just be patient..
